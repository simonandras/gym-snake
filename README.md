# gym-snake

### First Milestone

The first milestone was the own OpenAI Gym environment. The content of this is all the files except the files in the "Algorithms" folder. 
The environment is a snake game environment with adjustable shape. The code documentation is not ready yet. The env can be used as showed in the test.py, but it can be also used with the OpenAI function too: "env = gym.make('snake-v0', shape=(40, 40))".

I plan to implement some agents to the next milestone and compare their performance.
